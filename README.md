## Inventory Reports

CS project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

This project is a report generator that receives data from an entry file and returns a simple or a complete report over this data. The data can be obtained from a __CSV__, a __JSON__ or a __XML__ file.
I also could improve my skills with some __OOP__ concepts and apply a few Design Petterns, such as the __Iterator__ and the __Strategy__.
